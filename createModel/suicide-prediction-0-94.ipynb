Not moving and being in one spot, that makes you tired. When I leave therapy after a couple hours of giving it all I got, I feel more alive than anything. I thank God for these appointments and pieces of equipment and hands on deck that move my body. You know, as I sit here and think to myself, I want to encourage you to just try and be grateful for even all the little things. To try and think of all the small things that have carried you through. To enjoy all of the moments. To find those things, whether few or many, that give you a sense of purpose. It\\'s different for all of us. And isn\\'t that the coolest part? That we are all so different yet searching for the same thing? It blows my mind. Don\\'t let people bring you down, small people do that. Find those ones that want to lift you up, those that want to carry you on their journey of success. So you too can carry people on yours. Whether it\\'s a mistake, tragedy, loss, or just life running it\\'s course that has brought you to the here and now, I hope you can find peace in your current circumstance.

I\\'ve been blessed with incredibly supportive friends and family. Lately, things have been amazing. But there\\'s been multiple times where things haven\\'t been. I was born with congenial pulmonary lymph angestia; a rare lung condition that at the time of my diagnosis, there were 20 people in my state that had ever had it. At the time of my diagnosis, the disease had a 97% morality rate in infants. I weighed 3 pounds and 6 ounces. My lungs weren\\'t fully developed and they were filled with mucus. I was in the ICU for about six months before I was able to go home. At home, I had a heart monitor for my younger years, as well as frequent hospital trips caused by extreme difficulty breathing and physical developmental issues. When I was 16 until I was 19, I had to drop out of high school and become homeschooled because I got so sick. I couldn\\'t keep food down (the mucus in my stomach was affected as well, which we didn\\'t know about.), I couldn\\'t breathe, and I was 69lbs. I was so depressed and suicidal because I felt so terrible constantly. Waking up was hell. I was on about eight medications and eventually had toxic shock from all the medicine. Eventually, they found out that digestive enzymes helped and a treatment that finally started working for me. At my lowest points, I was heavily involved in self harm. I have post traumatic stress disorder from my time in and out of the hospital. I have nightmares about being in there. I lost a lot of my friends and my self confidence plummeted. I couldn\\'t look in the mirror without crying, and truly thought that I would be better off dead and that people would be happier without such a lieability. The depression and anxiety still fights me. I\\'m not always put together. And my disease flares up, a lot, usually at inconvient times. But my illness and my past. We are all more than what we seem.

I thought I would share my story in hope that it will inspire at least one person to get help. I was with my ex partner for just over a year, things were great..at the start. Until he got addicted and started to rely heavily on the drug crystal meth. That's when things started to get abusive and extremely violent and I started to lie to my friends that I wasn't seeing him, because they knew how abusive he was. I had to cover marks and bruises with make up. I refused to believe that he was an unstable person, and believed that I could change him, but I couldn't. One day we went out to a club and he drugged me, I woke up tied to a bed and was gang raped by him and 7 other people. He made me believe that I deserved the abuse and I would take it. Towards the end of the relationship he called me telling me to go to his house because there was some type of emergency. I went and found him having sexual intercourse with another male. That should have been the end of it right? Though a couple weeks later he texted me saying to meet me at his house because he wanted to apologise for everything that he did..stupidly I went, as soon as I arrived he grabbed the back of my head and smashed it into a brick wall, whilst choking me he forced himself on me. I didn't tell my parents about the abuse until about a year later, and told my friends that I managed to get him off me because that's what I wanted to believe. Though no one should be ashamed of domestic violence and rape. It's never your fault and you should always speak up and help is out there. If you have experienced and are going through something similar, please don't hesitate to seek help. If you would like support and someone to talk to don't hesitate to call BeyondBlue support service on 1300 22 46 36. If you are in an emergency call 000 straight away and ask for police.

I was struggling through my parents divorce and a really bad breakup. It led to anorexia which was one of the hardest things in my life to overcome so far. I was so skinny, if I laid down, you could see and feel my organs in my stomach. At the same time I was dealing with so much anxiety and depression that I could not even think straight. I hope no one ever has to go through the same struggles as myself. Because of my anorexia my family became concerned for me and instead of them trying to find help for me, they just pointed out my obvious weight loss to the point where I would feel even worse about myself. All these issues caused me to become extremely ill by my junior year and I was hospitalized 4 or 5 times that year do to malnutrition. Something snapped in me by the end of my junior year to the point where I just had to change myself or my life was going to go down the drain. I have gained my weight back to 120, but now I have to go through the struggle of people pointing out my weight gain, they are mostly good comments, but I still struggle at seeing myself at the weight I want to be. I look at pictures of myself from 4 years ago and say \"man I was skinny then\" and then I have to remind myself, no I was unhealthy.

For years and years I suffered with clinical depression. Dropping out of school in year 9 and being in and out of hospital for over 10 months. The demons were real and at the time I really did not want to be alive. I never thought it was possible to be happy again, or leave the small country town I was at. I was failing at school and for years my anxiety and depression ruled my life, how I felt. Who I spoke to, my eating habits, the way I saw my self, how I saw others.

So , at 3 months old i was given up for fostering due to my birth mother having addiction problems during her pregnancy with me. I was fostered for about 6 months and then adopted at 8 months . Growing up was hard for me because as a young boy in primary school trying to explain why i had two family trees and two \"tummy mummies\" was tough as i myself didn\\'t really understand what that meant. After many awkward and tough encounters with family members I decided to tell one of my closet friends my story. This was when i was entering high school. This person decided to tell others my story and this destroyed me. Everyone knew and was bothering me and teasing me and I felt so isolated. This led to years of bullying and trying to hide myself ,me being insecure and angry . I used to get so angry and confused and just wanted to be normal . So frustrated with the concept of trying to blend in. I was obsessed with the idea of being normal and this led to me retreating into myself , building walls in my friendships so i didn\\'t get hurt so easily . Adoption is such an amazing thing and personally I feel like there isnt enough publicity for me and my fellow peers that are adopted . THIS IS THE REASON IM DOING THIS . I want people that are adopted to know I UNDERSTAND YOU AND ITS OKAY! . Recently ive learned that what others tell me i am. And that my insecurities and my struggles.

       " \"Avery Ford I'm an entrepreneur and filmmaker in Kansas City, Missouri and you see. I was born with a condition in which one or both eyes is not properly aligned. I am also blind in my left eye. I went through most of my life feeling ashamed of how I looked. It wasn't until my late twenties that I learned to love myself just as I am. No one is perfect. We all have things that we would like to change about ourselves, but remember this- because you are here, you are worthy of love, happiness and human dignity. There isn't anything you need to do to earn your worthiness. It is your birthright. For so many years, I felt like I had to work a little harder to get people to see past my condition and connect to the real me. Now I see that this was never true. People have always seen the real me when I dared to show up and be present. What I know for sure is this: people see you too. Even when you feel invisible. Even when life knocks you down. If I can make peace with how I look, you can make peace with your insecurities. The world is waiting for you to show up in all of your glory. Will you answer the call? Hear more of my story at www.averyford.com thank you for your post :) \",\n",

Lizzie suffers from a rare congenital disease that less than 10 people in the world are known to have. The disease impedes her from accumulating body fat; she literally has zero percent body fat and has never weighed more than 64 pounds, however though it is not terminal. Throughout her entire life, this condition has resulted in a lot of It is so unacceptable to treat people like this. People are so quick to say horrible things about me everyday over and over and sometimes I can't take it. Even I at times get affected by it, I breakdown, I hide, I cry. It's resulted in a lot of anxiety for me that I've never had to deal with before ever. My every move has been documented for the whole world and its been a nightmare trying to find myself through all of this. And I've absolutely lost apart of myself. Lizzie, you are so strong and I admire you so so much. Lizzie has taken that negative energy and has turned it around by traveling around the world doing motivational speeches. When I asked her what the key messages were of her speeches, she told me that ‚ÄúMost importantly I try to convey that all you need to have is a brave heart to accomplish whatever you want to achieve. Let the negative build you up instead of knocking you down. You are enough no matter what; you were put on this earth for a reason‚Äù Soon you‚Äôll be able to see her story on the big screen in the documentary film in theaters on September 25th. Check out Lizzie‚Äôs Instagram - she‚Äôs taking a lifetime full of bullying to help teach the world the names they call me. and Lizzie taught me who I think I am. For me, this is expected it comes with the territory. But Lizzie, you should of not had to go through that. Let's change this together. I love you Lizzie! I'll see you soon. \",\n",

       "['In addition, people with BPD quite often have a weak self concept. They don\\'t always know who they really are deep down inside. They may always feel like there\\'s something missing or something wrong with them intrinsically. This can cause periods of dissociation and difficulty in maintaining a healthy sense of self esteem. They may have a weak value system (or one that is missing entirely) or find that they have a difficult time adhering to whatever value system they do have. Since there\\'s a real issue with trusting and black/white thinking, they don\\'t always trust in their own decisions and may do things to get people to \"like\" them or not leave them that would be against their value system normally, and think that they (themselves) are terrible/bad/evil people for doing it later. They often take their mistakes in life much more seriously than other people. A \"normal\" person may make the same mistake and feel bad about it, but it\\'s unlikely that they will see themselves as terrible/bad/evil for having made the mistake. Oftentimes, a person with BPD would make that mistake and internalize it as a personal failure...that it happened because they (themselves) are awful/bad/wrong. This means that their self concept is much more fluid than \"normal\" people. \\n\\nNow, please keep in mind that not all BPD sufferers have every single one of these symptoms. There are definitely other symptoms that can be included in the diagnosis, but this is a pretty good start and the most common symptoms sufferers may face. People with BPD need intense therapy because they must change how they see themselves and the world around them (having a more mature, realistic viewpoint of the world that isn\\'t all black or all white), rebuild value systems and self concepts that may be missing/aberrant, build the ability to trust others/self, and learn coping mechanisms. DBT (Dialectic Behavioral Therapy) was developed for BPD sufferers initially and has shown some positive results for sufferers who adhere to the techniques in their lives. \\n\\nHere\\'s the thing, too. It\\'s fairly common for Bipolar and BPD to be comorbid in a person (meaning they have both at the same time). We don\\'t necessarily know if there\\'s a genetic link between them, but we are beginning to think that\\'s possible. A person suffering from both at the same time (untreated) would tend to be extremely emotional, moody, hypersensitive to criticism, untrusting, self-damaging, with highs and lows in behavior that make their lives (and the lives of those who love them) quite difficult. They are chaotic because their brain isn\\'t working correctly due to chemical imbalances and, at the same time, their perception of themselves, other people and the world is one based on distrust and fear of being abandoned or rejected. They tend to have problems with love relationships, friendships, family relationships, and relationships with coworkers. Quite often, they end up being in the hospital for suicidal ideations or for mania (more often for depression than mania). It\\'s not uncommon for them to end up in the system for some time before they get a proper and correct diagnosis (and a good treatment plan). They may get kicked out of the system early with a misdiagnosis which leads to poor management of symptoms and relapsing.',\n",
       " 'LONG ANSWER: Bipolar disease is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. It can be treated with medication and therapy. Typically people with bipolar disease have learned to compensate for it in unhealthy ways (illegal drug use, eating disorders, gambling, promiscuity, alcoholism, self harm, etc.) and therapy can assist them with overcoming these unhealthy \"coping mechanisms.\" In addition, they may need therapy that assists with rebuilding family relationships that the sufferer (while in a relapse state) has damaged. Bipolar disease often causes lability of emotional response and potentially self-damaging behaviors that come from that. They tend to have periods of mania/hypomania and depression that is severe. During mania, they may feel like they have more energy, be happier (without reason), have grandiose ideas of themself and their abilities, need less sleep, be much more sexual, and engage in risky behaviors without considering the consequences. During depression, they may be suicidal, incapable of caring for themself, engage in self-harm, have a hard time leaving their house/bed, and miss a lot of work. Depending on what \"type\" of Bipolar a person has (Or where they fall on the spectrum) determines quite often how serious their periods of mania/hypomania are and how long those occur...and how serious their depressive episodes are and how long those occur. Regardless, it\\'s a difficult situation they live with constantly. Medication, typically, works to counterbalance the chemical imbalance in their brain (or offset the symptoms) so that they can function somewhat normally without huge highs and lows.',\n",

Got so sick and damn tired of repeating and repeating my life story to strangers I just quit. The day my twenty three year old beautiful daughter died after a hospital stay of only four days , its like my head just went numb and my eyes got tunneled and I could hold only one thought. She\\'s gone and she left behind a 2 year old, a 3 year old, and a 5 year old. I walked threw a week of going over my journals that I have written since I was old enough to know my alfabet and decided right then...fuck the professional head squeezers. Nothing up to that point was ever going to chemically balance my brain. Not even electro shock treatments could erase my history because they tried.  I had 51 years of hell that brought me to the most hellish day of my life..  Losing my daughter everyone who knew me thought I would kill myself. Not once in all my abused life did it ever occur to me to ever take my own life. It didn\\'t occur to me then and still doesn\\'t today. I am 56 and a half years old. In all the horrifying days since my birth from every page of every journal I ever wrote their was palpable anger as my only emotion. I take the drug Rispedol to control my anger. I have taken it for at least 28 years maybe 30. I get 10 of the lowest does xanex they make and sometimes I might have to take them all in a month sometimes only one or two if I blow out a panic attack. And I get sixty 7.5 norco pain pills a month for sever reahmatoid arthritis. In the cold set nasty months I use them all every month and still cry all night from pain. But the moral to this shitty life is this. The day my beautiful daughter died in a mental hospital thru their carelessness because they \" accidentally \" overdosed her on her fourth day...at that moment in time I was on 13 pills three times a day for every freaking mental condition all these idiot docs could come up with when all I really needed was control. I DO NOT BY ANY MEANS RECCOMMED you stop seeing your so called mental health provider. But I beg you look at your own life. Go back to your earliest memory write yourself an honest account of your life. If you like me have kept journals go back highlight the events that caused you pain, made you mad, or gave you emmence grief. Ask yourself for every event you highlight what was going threw your mind at that moment. Mental and physical pain most of all. Don\\'t just write down the pain you felt at any given moment...write down what you wanted to do at that moment. The seconds minutes, hours, day, weeks, months, years of your torment. Were you suicideal, or homicidal, did you want to disapper.... What were you feeling at that moment. You wanted to live. For sure you wanted to live or you would not have. Then highlight after that threat of life and death was over what did you want to do after the event that  you just survived and you deal with that issue cause let me tell you know...you can\\'t forget. Fuck forgiveness. That\\'s not possible no matter what they tell you because you can\\'t forget. Fuck labels. They just give it all a new name for every drug they give you. There is no closure because there is no door that can be closed that\\'s going to make you forget. Deal only with what keeps you from living and understand this one freaking rule of life. We are born, we survive until we die. Nobody gives a shit what our real sufferings are because they feel we don\\'t care about theirs.  Labels mean shit. Not shit!

I can't really tell since my anxiety is so bad anyway that I doubt I'd notice if it were made a tiny bit worse.  It would have to make me MUCH worse in order for me to notice, but it can (for some people) cause increased anxiety.\\n\\nIf you have any side effects that are bothersome or that make you feel worse, I'm sure you already know to return to your doctor and get the medication switched.

       " 'Copy and pasted from a page. Hope it helps.\\n\\nIn regards to bipolar:\\n\\nBipolar is a complex, mental health disorder.  Its most common forms are Bipolar I (mania and depression) and Bipolar II (hypomania and depression), however other forms do exist.  Due to the cyclic nature of this disorder, it is often times difficult to treat.  And because of society‚Äôs stigmatization of the disorder, those who are suffering from bipolar often times feel embarrassed or ashamed, leading to them not getting the help they need.\\n\\nBipolar I is the most common form of bipolar that society talks about.  It is characterized by a cycle of really high, highs and really low, lows.  Individuals with this type of bipolar may experience a period of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù mood in between mood swings, during which their mood and energy level feels ‚Äúright‚Äù and their ability to function is not disturbed.  During the high periods, symptoms can include taking on too many activities at once, spending money in ways that cause trouble, becoming more talkative, outgoing or sexual, and consumption or increased consumption of alcohol and/or drugs.  These symptoms may lead to others perceiving the sufferer as strange or annoying and can cause trouble with co-workers or authority figures.  During the low periods sufferers often feel a lack of energy, a need to stay in bed or get extra sleep, and little or no motivation to do things they need to do.  They often put on weight during these periods and feel sad or depressed all the time.  Sometimes, during the low phases, they may feel helpless or even suicidal.  Their ability to function at work or socially can become impaired (Bipolar Spectrum Diagnostic Scale).  \\n\\nBipolar II is characterized by hypomania, meaning a slight increase in mood, followed by depression.  Hypomanic episodes are defined by feeling incredibly productive and happy.  Sufferers may see themselves as being in a high functioning mode and feel that there is nothing wrong during these periods.  The depressive episodes are defined by a prolonged period (at least two weeks) of feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and disinterest in taking part in life. During these low phases sufferers often feel fatigued, restless, agitated, unfocused, indecisive, and in some cases, suicidal (Bipolar Spectrum Diagnostic Scale).\\n\\nBecause bipolar involves both highs and lows, it can be difficult to treat.  If someone stays manic their physician will focus on bringing their mood down to a healthier happy.  This, however, can be difficult to accomplish as many people who suffer from mania enjoy the extra energy, creativity, and intensity that comes with it.  Likewise, it can be difficult to treat the depression that comes with bipolar because the medications used to treat the depression can unfortunately cause a manic episode.  It is also not uncommon for bipolar medications to stop working overtime, causing an individual who was once stable on medication to cycle and have to start the search for an effective medication over again.  Lastly, some of the medications used to treat bipolar are known for causing side effects in some people.  Knowing this keeps some people from trying medications that might actually help them.  \\n\\nFrom my 14 years working with an adult psychiatrist and my 9 years as a licensed counselor, I can attest to the stigma many individuals suffering from bipolar struggle with.  Society has wrongly blamed bipolar disorder for causing people to commit horrific acts such as assault and murder.  Society has also misused the term in a negative sense to describe people they do not like, strange weather, mechanical issues with their car etc.; the list goes on.  These derogatory and inaccurate associations keep people from seeking help because they fear being diagnosed with bipolar and then being labeled as ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù by their family and friends.  When I have a client that has received an official diagnosis of bipolar from a doctor, one of the first things I often have to do is work with them to see and accept that society is wrong, that they are truly not crazy or dangerous.  I then have to help them work through their fear of being out casted by everyone in their lives so that they can tell their mom or dad or best friend about their diagnosis and what they are going through. \\n\\nOverall, bipolar can be one of the hardest mental health disorders to suffer from.  It can present differently from person to person but it always has a component of fluctuating moods.  The best thing someone suffering from bipolar can do is think about how wrong society is about most things and then remind themselves that society is wrong about bipolar too.\\n\\nHeather N.

I wouldn't suggest seeing a therapist because they're all just strangers and I've always became extra anxious and paranoid when I got out because I would think I said something bad, or off.

Up for days, little sleep, isolated, lost dramatic amount of weight, etc. Ropinarole is very effective with restless leg syndrome and I take that am and pm, very helpful in settling me down to a more comfortable level.  Abilify is also another sleep med that seems to be very helpful to some,but did not work for me. So there are other medications to help you. Can you get to see your provider on an emergent basis or maybe discuss with your provider's nurse who will be your voice? I ended up hospitalized for almost 3 weeks and would not be discharged until my sleep stabilized. I was also wrongly diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety for years. So many factors can be considered when insomnia is uncontrolled. My case is extreme and I was a mess, but not something I had control over. You have to advocate/speak up for yourself. I also had my husband with me before being hospitalized to substantiate my condition. Plus, it was a legal intervention because I ended up in an uncontrollable, destructive rage.

Loving a partner with Bipolar is difficult. The Bipolar turns them into somebody that you don't recognize, somebody that's not the real person you fell in love with. Instead of being an equal partner in a relationship you are expected to be a carer when they suffer depression and you have to suffer the emotional abuse often on the other end of the scale. Bipolar has robbed me of all my trust in my relationship but I am hanging in there. Perhaps your partner is afraid to face the bipolar situation? Afraid that he has lost the person he loves? It's lonely being the partner of a sufferer, I sometimes feel alone when I am sitting in the same room as my wife. Escapism, to a certain degree, is natural. Who doesn't want to escape the one thing that worries and stresses them out the most? Us guys just want to take care of our loved ones and families but when I feel there is nothing I can do I feel worthless and not up to the task, a failure. That can be destructive. Mental illness is not fair, Bipolar is not fair. I would recommend returning to counselling and also for both of you to learn more on Bipolar together.

I only recognize the symptoms now since I\\'ve been diagnosed & educated about this debilitating disorder. Beforehand, I just thought I was extremely depressed. I can relate to what you\\'re going through. I remember many days of not being able to get out of bed to shower or get dressed. All I felt like doing was cry & sleep. I couldn\\'t eat & having to interact with another human being was a living nightmare. I tried many different medications until I finally found one that made a difference. Not all medications affect people in the same way so it\\'s important to work with a mental health physician to figure out what works best for you. I\\'m not gonna say medication is a fix all but it definitely does decrease symptoms & make life more bearable & worth living again. Getting enough rest is also just as equally important. Sometimes during a manic  episode sleep may seem impossible & there are medications available to help with that but personally I choose melatonin which is all natural.

A life where you're exhausted, but because of work not my disability. I want to feel stress.

I'm a strong person I just haven't tried hard enough, which hurts kinda of to say because I believe I do try. I try every damn day to wake up and be ok but most of the time my demons stop me and get the best of me. But the last 5 months, something clicked. In April I lost my medical insurance, and I've been going all this time without my pills. I was on trazadone, lamotrigine, propranolol etc... but I've been staying with my bfs mom and she's been such great help and I realized with a change of environment (for me, in my own case not suggesting this works for everyone) I've changed completely. A friend is helping me get a part time job and I couldn't be happier or more proud of myself for facing my fears. The point of this long comment is that, I wish I did what I'm trying to do now when I was your age because I'm getting older and now it's gonna take me longer to be who I want to be. Don't make my mistake. I've seen people with worst cases of paranoia schizophrenia and be amazing successful people speaking in front of crowds and hallucinating at the same time but pushing it to the side to be able to do their job and you'd never guess. You can work with ptsd, anxiety, etc. Is it going to be easy? No. Are you gonna  mess up, have an episode maybe even lose your job? Yeah tbh, but you get up, take care of yourself first, and try again. I hope you see this as helpful and not judging or a negative comment because I promise it's not.

If someone is diabetic and needs to have insulin but doesn't want to cos it's 'medication' you would be cross at them. Their body needs the medication to help their body as it doesn't make the insulin. The same goes for depression just a different organ. My brain doesn't make enough of the chemicals it needs to get me throu just like a diabetic doesn't make insulin to get them throu. \\nI even tried on meds that were to low and I just couldn't keep my head above water but now I'm settled on the meds that are working for me I have no desire to go back to the horrid struggles. Don't get me wrong things aren't all peachy and good I still have struggles but I'm much better at managing those times. \\nThe other thing I learnt was people wait to look to get help.

I'd rather look at it in this way; rather than getting caught up with fixating on the medication as a bad thing, I believe if it is helping, if is making you feel better, if it is the crutch that is helping you live your life, enjoy your children, if is it allowing you to cope then surely it's got to be worth it and it is making the difference between your life working and not working.\\n\\nI got so caught up at one stage when I had rebuilt my life and recovered in the idea that I had to come off them.  I thought I was coping well and knew I wasn't depressed.  I even went to the doctors and tried to discuss the idea of coming off them. I had convinced myself leading up to the appointment that this was the best step, but deep down I had a nagging doubt that if I encountered anything particularly difficult whether I'd be able to cope.\\n\\nLuckily my doctor was great, we discussed it fully and she helped me to see that being on the medication isn't a sign of weakness, it's nothing to feel guilty or ashamed of and coming off them too quickly might not be the best plan.  I guess I knew that deep down, I had just got so caught up with the idea that to be fully better I needed to come off the medication.\\n\\nI think especially if you have a lot of stress in your life it might not be the best time to come off.\\n\\nDiscuss it with the professionals, talk to your loved ones, but don't feel you have to rush into anything.

I learned about my disorders. But when it really got bad. This after my ex left. And took the kids to Parts Unknown.  I've had two nervous breakdowns. And the first one was really bad. I tried three times to kill myself. Twice with a shotgun and once with pills. It was weeks later my Doctor found out about the pills. Banding a map I took along with alcohol. I should have died that day. But I got the worst case of diarrhea. I had to sit on the toilet all day and half the night. I realized I couldn't kill myself. But I didn't know I was going to die Not once but twice in one evening. Months later. I had gotten bit by a rattlesnake. Halfway point between Where I live to where the hospital where I got the Anti-Venom because the hospital here only had two vials.  Halfway to the other hospital I had died twice. First time I died The EMT brought me back. But then I died again. The second time I woke up. And seen. EMT coming at me what the paddles To shock me Back to life. Which he almost shocked himself when I asked him what he was doing. Then I realize my chest was hurting me. He had been pounding on my chest to get my heart started back up again. He had told me. But during the time I was dead. I thought I would just dreaming. I still felt the pain and hurts. Not the physical hurts. But the mental hurts. That's what I learned.

Just don't stay And one spot and do nothing. This is not going to stop it from happening. But it will lessen the pain. Because if you're too busy doing something That can be enjoyable. Then you won't have time to think about the other things. The key is to stay active And do it when you don't feel like doing it. Also keep in mind don't push too hard. A little bit at a time will Build You Up. Then to try to do it all at once. Last time can be done with anxiety and panic attacks. Don't ever brush it or try to do it like others do it. Do it at your own pace. So get active and stay active. Also keep in mind no one can make you do anything. But nothing can be accomplished by doing nothing. Talk to who you can.

No wonder you have had these thoughts that you can't go on, you don't want to be here and just can't see anything ever improving.\\nIt's a viscous cycle of ruminating, feeling alone, abandoned, desperate, constantly miserable and not being able to see an end to it all.\\nWhen you need the strength, drive and determination to beat this hideous illness, those are the things which you often don't have.\\nPlease please don't give up hope.  Your family need you and want you.  You expressed that your friends don't understand, but you haven't really totally opened up to your family?

It is very often the case we push our families away for many reasons, but can they truly help and support if they don't really know?\\nRe the diagnosis, medical appointments and medication.  The recent diagnosis is only the beginning with regards to those issues, is there no ongoing support from those? I'm no expert, but diagnosis in itself is surely of little help if there is nothing provided on the back of that?\\nForgive me as I assume you might be in the US and I'm in the Uk and clearly services are very different, but diagnosis alone could make things worse in the short term without the follow up support as it might just leave you with so many unanswered questions?\\nAgain re the medical apps and medication, this all can be instrumental in providing a stable platform to build recovery.  If the meds aren't right, then it can be so much more difficult.  I often view medication as a necessary (in many cases) crutch to provide the stability to move forward.  You explained these appointments are expensive, but what is the potential cost to you, your family and your daughter if they are not working?\\nOnce the medication is right, the appointments then can hopefully lessen.\\nI really understand your pain having suffered previously for so long, but I also know unfortunately the pain and carnage a suicide leaves behind.  When you are in the middle of the quagmire of severe depression, we don't always rationally view everything.  So much can get obscured and we can make some terrible decisions.\\nMy psychiatrist warned me against making any big decisions while I was suffering as we view the world very differently.  I put no more thought into buying a house than a loaf of bread. Nothing had any meaning.  It is so hard to see the wood for the trees (apologies for my English metaphors!) \\nI've seen both sides I guess.  I know all too well the effect a suicide has on those close loved ones for a lifetime, your parents and your daughter of course don't want to have to live with that.  I'm sure they all love you very much and would want to do all they could to help if they really could understand your pain.\\nI'm so sorry to run on and I also know it is far from easy, but in short in the grand scheme of things I guess the cost of the appointments and the potential happy life you could have is worth the money.\\nThere is a real chance of having a better future, a chance to be happy.\\nPost depression for me is the start of my new life.  My depression (well the last big one) was my previous life.\\nSmall, achievable steps are possible, but you need support and love, care, compassion.  Be kind to yourself, you deserve to beat this, you all deserve a better life.  Best wishes, thinking of you x\",\n",

My mother has chronic situational depression (it's easily triggered and close to being clinical she just doesn't talk about shit so I think if she did it would be considered clinical). My brother has severe anxiety and OCD, and depression can be easily triggered for him. I know later down our family line we likely have far more mental illnesses that aren't mentioned at all. But I know because I leaned so strongly towards my bipolar genes that I showed symptoms around 9 and got diagnosed officially at 13 which is practically unheard of (especially 12 years back). But it was obvious what the signs were. Most children under 16 aren't ever diagnosed. I was diagnosed at 11 with depression and put on useless (for me) and low dose anti-depressants.

But hey I'm not a doctor that is just what I've hear from doctors whilst in treatment centers. Also I don't know exactly what YOUR bipolar disorder experience is like. It's different for all of us. Right now you have two people to think about your unborn child, which God bless him or her needs to be taken care of before and after birth and then there is you, the primary part of the puzzle.

But what you need to have right now and what I'll need to have in the future is faith. Yes talk to your doctor about possibly getting off the Zoloft because maybe it's causing those bad thoughts and do the technical psychiatric part of the process but like they say there is science and then there is God. I encourage you, if you are a praying woman, to pray on it especially when you get those thoughts. He will listen. Do it for you. Do it for that blessed child. All will be alright I promise you.

Firstly, I don't think anybody here will ever say they know what you are going through. We all know that every person's condition is different, we might have similar diagnosis but how that condition affects you is not how it affects me. Friends and family who say this are most likely only trying to be there for you. Sadly it can feel as an insult but there is nothing you can do about other people. With regards to your people pleasing behaviour, well I've found that most of those suffering from a mental condition are in fact always people pleasers. We give unconditionally to the point where it drains us. It's hard to focus only on yourself because you don't want to feel selfish. Take it from a person who used to be a doormat, look after yourself and if you have time and energy you can see if you can help others. Lonely wanderer, well I think it sums up many of us here. Our conditions trap us in our minds and it's a lonely place. Personally I have no friends either, this is by choice as I have certain expectations from anybody who wants to be in my close circle. I don't trust easily, due to the once bitten twice shy syndrome. Does it bother me? Not in the least. Faith and belief, yeah well what can I say. For some it works, personally I want to vomit in my mouth when people tell me to pray etc. I've seen and experienced too much in my life to believe in anything that cannot be proven. Suicidal thoughts, at are worst we all have to deal with them. How you do that is up to you, does it matter that others don't appreciate you dealing with it on your own? Hell no. If it works for you then they can go fly a kite. Do people care about your pain? Maybe, but at the end of the day most people are selfish and care about their own issues only.  We all get tired of fighting this endless battle, in fact I have been stable for 4 years, yet after almost dying last month, coming home to the same shit, I actually wished I never survived. Does it make me weak? No, the fact that I'm still here means that I'm a tougher cookie than most people.

I even wrote a suicide note. When I told my psychiatrist, he didn't even bat an eye. No med adjustment. I had gotten through the crisis myself without going to hospital. The thing is, I completely was suicidal and it all hedged on if I could find a place to live or not. I am disabled. It was January. I had just lost my van in the summer and was not moving by choice. I have pets, a mobility scooter and my son backed out of sharing a place with me at the last minute (I can't afford a place on my own. I live in the third most expensive place to rent a one bedroom in Canada) My daughter could only take me for two weeks or lose her rent subsidy and possibly get evicted so that was out. I had nowhere to go. I had been homeless before and I just didn't have the strength to do it again. To lose everything again and end up in a tiny room without my pets was just too much for me. I planned it. Of course the day I was to surrender my dog to a rescue I got the call that my now roommate and I were approved for a place. I had planned on not waking up the next morning. But I digress. Your Therapist said you will always have those thoughts. My psychiatrist never even addressed it. And no, I can't just get another doc. There's a doctor shortage here.

I wish I had all the answers.\\n\\nI'm wondering how long you have been seeing your therapist and if you feel seeing them is helping.\\n\\nYou also state you are taking medication, but still feel as bad as this.  Have you been taking them for a long time and does your therapist feel they are the right tablets and the right dose as you are still struggling so much?\\n\\nThe only thing with trying to help and to feed back is the need to ask further questions, only just to try to think of things which might help.\\n\\nYou talk about the feelings you have to your wife.  I'm wondering how long you have been together, how supportive she is and I guess deep down how you feel about your relationship?\\n\\nCan you remember the feelings you had when you first got together, what attracted you, can you recall some of those happy memories? That's a difficult one, only you can really come to the conclusion how you really feel.\\n\\nDo you have any meaningful activities in your life? You didn't say whether you are able to work?\\n\\nWith regards to considering why you cut yourself, it's hard to say as luckily I have never done that, not that I didn't consider doing something and it's probably hard to remember the exact thoughts before and while you were doing it.  I remember the thoughts when I considered it, people have suggested probably already the main reasons people do it such as actually wanting to feel something as depression often makes you literally feel numb while at the same time your head can be in such a turmoil.\\n\\nI'm wondering too if it can be the culmination of pent up anger, resentment and frustration when you can't escape the desperate situation you are in.  When there seems nothing you can do to escape other than if you are lucky; sleep sometimes, could this be a way of interrupting the cycle of over thinking and feeling dreadful?\\n\\nOften I knew I wanted to escape.  I wasn't living, merely existing.  Whilst battling depression and anxiety day after day, the desire to 'be' somewhere else was immense, but it always seemed so illusive.  When we crave contentment and peace, the happy lives so many seem to have, then occasionally death might seep into our thoughts as a better alternative to the sh*t we are always feeling.\\n\\nI knew, luckily that wasn't the answer and also I didn't want to not be here, I just didn't want to be 'there'. I guess what I'm trying to say is we so desperately want all this pain to end and sometimes ending it all seems to only solution.\\n\\nOf course it's not, there is a better way, recovery and a better life is the way, the key, but to reach that can seem such a monumental task.\\n\\nTo get there unfortunately can take a long time, but it is possible and real, but you do need people to help, it's necessary to lean on people and to let them help.  Recovery relies on many things, some very small, but all important.\\n\\nAre there any other agencies you can access? Charities? Peer support? Exercise is really good, but small, achievable and significant steps are key, goals are helpful, not huge goals, small ones, little steps, exercise can literally begin with just sitting in the sun, feeling the sun on your face, trying once again to feel the sensations of the weather around you, building up to perhaps a short walk and building up from there.\\n\\nOf course I don't want to patronise and 'teach you to suck eggs' as they say over here, but just trying to remember the things which helped me on the road to better mental health.\\n\\nGoing back to the self harm, Im wondering sometimes it might also be wanting to actually feel something.  The illness and the drugs can leave you feeling nothing and inflicting pain on yourself will make you feel, it might also divert your thoughts from the pain you feel inside your head to the actual physical pain?\\n\\nIt is so hard to put into words what I thought when I considered it, I felt as though I wanted to punish myself in some way that was payback for not being able to beat this hideous illness.  I think I felt a failure and weak in some way that the depression was winning and I wasn't strong enough to control it, it was controlling me and why wasn't I able to fight this off and get better? Also I hated being so self centred.  With depression I felt I spent all my days going over and over the past, reliving awful things that had happened and just wallowing in self pity.  I hated it, that's not me, I'm not selfish, but I couldn't stop it, was self hard a way of hurting myself? Did I deserve to be punished? Of course I didn't, but I couldn't see it at the time.  We can be so hard on ourselves.  \\n\\nMental illness is so hard when we have such conflicting emotions and having the strength to recover just alludes us when we need it most.\\n\\nSo sorry to run on so, just trying to really think if there is anything which you might be able to relate to.\\n\\nA healthy diet and trying to introduce things to give your life meaning are very important.  I know it can be hard when sometimes it's not even possible to get out of bed, but you have done so well in admitting things and getting help.  The desire to get better is the key.  \\n\\nThere is a better way, recovery and inner peace is possible, but it takes time, we must try so hard for ourselves, we owe it to ourselves to beat this and to our loved ones, best wishes, always here x\",\n",

When someone has been a carer for any length of time, if the person they are caring for dies this can leave a huge void for the bereaved.  Not only can you grieve for them deeply, regardless of the relationship, but your whole purpose and role has disappeared overnight.  You provided such a valuable and worthwhile lifeline and service, which you knew helped so much, so when that's all gone it is perfectly feasible that you will literally feel redundant.\\n\\nPersonal loss in any form can leave the bereaved feeling lost, alone or abandoned.  Caring for someone as much as you did can   also mean the person left behind is just no longer needed.\\n\\nDealing with grief for anyone can be so hard, let along someone who may have other difficulties such as mental health problems. The impact can be far more severe.\\n\\nDeath is very hard to comprehend sometimes.  How can someone be there, so close one day and so far away the next? We need logic in our lives to understand and make any sense, death robs us of that.\\n\\nRecovery from the loss of a loved one and coming to terms with the grief is usually most effective if we can learn to manage the grief finding a way forward to build a new life, with new purpose, where you can feel needed once again and but holding onto those precious memories of our loved ones.\\n\\nI've noticed many others have suggested good, possible ways of moving forward, a new interest, putting your wonderful talents and qualities to a good and valuable use and to help you feel valued again so you can hopefully begin to feel as though you are providing a worthwhile service to someone or something in the case of a pet or animal charity.\\n\\nThere are so many deserving causes which I'm sure would love to have someone such as yourself volunteering.\\n\\nWhen I was at an all time low, my goal eventually was to do some worthwhile voluntary work, get a meaningful job and to do a course to learn something new as well as several other things which would help such as exercise, a healthy diet and sunlight etc.  None of these things happen overnight and to me it was small, but significant steps towards an eventual goal.\\n\\nIt's not easy of course, I won't pretend it is, but it is possible, but you also need to lean on those who care and engage with outside help too if it is available, i.e. Professionals and charities, sorry to run on, not trying to preach, just thinking of anything which might just help, best wishes, xx\",\n",

Apparently, my stomach was moving the food through too fast and not allowing time to absorb nutrition from the food, leaving me w 6 vitamin deficiencies. My Dr prescribed an antispasmodic for me about 3 months ago. The difference is night and day!!! 3 gastroenterologist couldn't help me, after multiple endoscopies and colonoscopies. But one Dr who listened actually helped. I now barely bloat, can finish a meal without multiple bathroom breaks, and am starting to fit into my clothing again. \\n\\nI hope this information helps you.

As a mother of a teenage son with acute anxiety it can be so so hard.  As a parent we want to fix things, make everything ok and if we can't we can feel so helpless.\\n\\nIt's such an awful feeling to see your son suffer so much.  Acute anxiety can be so crippling, many people just don't realise, some even completely don't understand or wrongly assume.\\n\\nWe just want to make everything ok and when we can't we can feel a failure at times, when sometimes there just isn't anything we can do to make things ok.\\n\\nWith my son one of the main things he needed and relied upon was my strength, resilience, understanding and knowing I was always there for him, through thick and thin.  If I was to falter or push him into something he wasn't happy with then I know he couldn't have coped.  I believe they need loved ones to understand and be there for them.  It is hard enough to deal with the problems it makes everything so much worse when they believe people don't understand.\\n\\nOne of most frustrating things I've found about mental illness is the slow rate of recovery and being able to move forward.  It can take so long to build up the confidence needed to be able to do things.  When we crave the day when our children and young people can essentially be able to live a 'normal' life, it can be heartbreaking to see them struggling with a half life, battling with their demons on a daily basis.\\n\\nWhen we see others, their peers living happy, fruitful and care free lives, it is so hard to know  what our young people are going through especially when we see their youth disappearing, not being able to fulfill their potential, not being happy.\\n\\nSometimes it's just too painful to really contemplate and it's better for our own sanity to just focus on the here and now and try to put our energies into the daily challenges.\\n\\nBecause progress can seem so painfully slow, e.g. getting a job, learning to drive, it's important to try to focus on smaller steps, smaller goals, by gentle encouragement and with kind praise and empathic reinforcement.  It has to be more their pace than ours as frustrating as it often is.\\n\\nQuite often unfortunately, the pressure this brings on us has adverse effects and can lead to mental health problems for the parent/s who bare the lions share of the stress.  We aren't always strong enough which makes things extra hard.\\n\\nDo you have any other professional support for you or your son?\\n\\nIt can feel so isolating when you see others effectively leading normal lives.\\n\\nThings can get better, it's finding that way forward to 'beat' the conditions so they can control it rather than it controlling them, this can come with maturity and using each productive experience as evidence that they have overcome their anxiety on a particular day, or in a specific activity.\\n\\nI'm sure you are doing a wonderful job and together as a team things will get better, but unfortunately it can take a lot of time, care and patience, best wishes x\",\n",

Remember manic isnt always happy and feeling great, it can also be just irrational and irratable behavior, really anything where you have pent up energy that doesnt go away. Periods of pent up energy that manifests in negative emotions and actions are probably a mixed state, which is when you have to be very mindful and aware as they can be the most dangerous part of living with bipolar. I would journal as much as you can, details about how you feel, when you feel that way, things you do, how you act, triggers that send you into depressed states or irritable or manic etc. this can really help a psychiatrist see a pattern that makes it easier to diagnose whatever is going on.',\n",

I have definitely noticed it happens easier now of i forget my meds now that my body is accustomed to getting lithium and effexor (and other meds) on a regular basis. Lessening the anxiety does have the potential to help lessen dissociative spells.

While we were trying to figure out what works best for me we tried a medication that caused visual hallucinations, but I contacted him and he imminently discontinued that medication and got me in the same week to make sure I was alright. It's important to note that although that was not a pleasant experience I didn't give up hope because I reminded myself that the goal was to get better and only rarely when trying to figure out the best way to do something is it ever gotten right on the first try. Even when I started taking the medication that I'm using today I had to deal with stomach discomfort (constipation / weight gain) but I counter acted those side effects by changing my diet and forcing myself to start exercising. A funny thing about that is that I started taking a natural probiotic (extremely healthy and all natural) supplement to help with the constipation and for the first week I felt like I had to use the restroom ALL the time even when I didn't have any stool to dispose of.\\nOne thing to keep in mind is the fact that you're going to feel different, but that's the point.

       " 'Ok first of all, Marae Corday,  there is no snapping out of anything, no more than snapping out of schizophrenia. My husband suffers from this disorder and it can be devastating and no one with this disease chooses to be this way. Second of all just because someone has bipolar disorder doesn\\'t mean they are stupid or incapable of being independent or self reliable. That all depends on the severity of their disease and their individual progress with treatment. There are actually a great deal of very intelligent and successful people, including celebrities who suffer from bipolar. Their is no doubt that someone with bipolar must have a strong network of family and friends to be supportive and help them when they need it but let me assure you that mental illness is in no way a first world problem as you like to call it. Mental illness stretches beyond all social classes, race, culture, religion, etc. I can assure you it is very much a global problem. The only difference between our \"first world\" and other \"third world\" countries is the attitude and acceptance of which we acknowledge and treat mental illness here. For example, most Americans have compassion and acceptance of mental illness without blaming the person who suffers while a smaller number of douchebags, such as yourself, have no understanding or sympathy of anyone else\\'s pain except your own and just expect people to snap out of something they can not control. Let me tell you one thing right now, there has always been a disgusting stigma associated with mental illness that it is somehow bull shit, or can be prevented or avoided which is further perpetuated by people like you, but there is absolutely no difference between mental illness and any other physical diseases such as cancer or diabetes. It is a physical chemical/hormonal imbalance of the brain. Would you tell someone with cancer or diabetes to snap out of it? If you can\\'t educate yourself on such matters and have an enlightened and intelligent point of view on such matters, then it would probably be more beneficial for you to refrain from commenting your idiocy because it reflects poorly on your character and makes you look like a horses ass.',\n",

Deciding to live is not for someone else, it\\'s not for anyone else\\'s benefit, it\\'s for me. I\\'m not going to decide against killing myself or mutilation because I think my friend will be sad. During the time I was considering it all, I did not once stop to think huh.. I wonder how this will affect the world once I\\'m gone. No, instead, I learned to live for myself.

Stop calling suicidal people selfish, they have enough pain weighing them down, they already spend every waking moment thinking things that would kill a person of less grit and perseverance (literally) instead what you can do, show them you are there for them.

The black hole that is clinical depression is all-consuming. Feeling like a burden to loved ones, feeling like there is no way out, feeling trapped and feeling isolated are all common among people who suffer from depression.\\n\\nPeople who say that suicide is selfish always reference the survivors. It‚Äôs selfish to leave children, spouses and other family members behind, so they say. They‚Äôre not thinking about the survivors, or so they would have us believe. What they don‚Äôt know is that those very loved ones are the reason many people hang on for just one more day. They do think about the survivors, probably up until the very last moment in many cases. But the soul-crushing depression that envelops them leaves them feeling like there is no alternative. Like the only way to get out is to opt out. And that is a devastating thought to endure.\\n\\nUntil you‚Äôve stared down that level of depression, until you‚Äôve lost your soul to a sea of emptiness and darkness... you don‚Äôt get to make those judgments. You might not understand it, and you are certainly entitled to your own feelings, but making those judgments and spreading that kind of negativity won‚Äôt help the next person. In fact, it will only hurt others.\\n\\nAs the world mourns the loss of Robin Williams, people everywhere are left feeling helpless and confused.

Most people I have talked to who have struggled with suicidal thoughts (myself included) think that if they do give into their thoughts, then they will be doing others a favor. It is a cruel battle between thoughts and actions.',\n",

       " 'I think this is too vague and complex to be answered in the same catch all way, because the human experience is just so different due to perspective. I like the way you both calmly talked about this so I\\'d like to put in my perspective.. I think you are both right. Selfish is not the right word however, what you are describing is actually someone being inconsiderate. They have a disregard for their family and friends feelings in the aftermath, they are thinking only of themselves. But, on the other hand, this inconsiderate thought is not to be blamed on the suicidal individual in question. Most suicidal people don\\'t have the capacity to even think that far ahead, the future is bleak and dark and full of seemingly endless pain. I have struggled with mental illness my entire life. I grew up very poor and a homeless youth. During this time I didn\\'t even know the thoughts I had were not \"normal\". My mind a physical being had so much pain it was blinding. I attempted 3 times. Not once did I consider going to family or friends. I didn\\'t have family that loved me (still don\\'t) and I didn\\'t have close friends. I\\'m sure even if I did, I wouldn\\'t have been considerate enough of their feelings to persuade me to stay alive for their benefit alone. The internal fight isn\\'t about anyone else. It\\'s only about you. It\\'s a struggle within to overcome pain and heal what isn\\'t working. By therapy, meditation, lifestyle, fitness, yoga, meditation etc. During this time, we have to be selfish, we have to be inconsiderate, because if we aren\\'t, we will die. Living is not for someone else, it\\'s not for anyone else, it\\'s for me. I recently decided I needed have more serious treatment and went to a doctor when my dad passed away this February. I found out im bipolar, boarding between 1&2, I\\'m somewhere in the middle. I also have chronic depression and ptsd from extensive childhood abuse. I understand more than ever about my suicidal nature and that it was only my battle. And that incredible pain you feel, is your brain keeping you alive.

It can be terrible at times.\\n\\nHowever taking medication isn't always easy for some people, so completely understand the things you ve said.  Really well done for seeking help, best wishes x\",\n",

       " \"Do you know if he's having a manic episode, depressive or mixed? I live with bipolar disorder and I have different methods for different episodes. The hardest part about a depressive episode for me is that there is literally just no stimulation in my brain. Someone could run in my room with fireworks and I probably wouldn't react much to it. But because I accepted that my brain's chemistry isn't reacting properly and I know this, I've learned to force myself to get restimulated. It's not easy at all and it's a process that can take days or weeks with many speed bumps but 1. I get a decent amount of sunlight every day 2. I do something active every day. Even if it's only a 15 minute walk. But I try to at least go for a 30 minute run to get the juices flowing. Also killing 2 birds with one stone if you run outside. 3. I make a short to do list every day. Nothing crazy, maybe 3-4 things. And a lot of days I only do one, or none. And it's frustrating and I want to give up and go back to bed and quit. But the next day I get up and try it again. And I tell myself it's ok and try to maintain positive thoughts. Because the anxious and bad thoughts I know aren't organic, they aren't my thoughts. They're called intrusive thoughts for a reason. They come and they go but I don't let them decide who I am as a person. Eventually after a while of pushing myself I start realizing that I WANT to run when I wake up. And I WANT to get that school assignment done. And I WANT to take care of myself and continue building the foundation of my future. As a partner of someone living with BP I would suggest being that gentle support. Suggest going on a walk or run with them, or ask them if they at least want to sit outside for a bit. Maybe invest in something like a hammock, they still don't have to move or leave home but they at least are outside which is one small step closer. The to do list is big for me, my anxiety builds up exponentially when I let things like school or work pile up and it makes me shut down even harder. But when I start getting things done, no matter how small or simple, it really helps my confidence come back.

Before my Autism diagnosis I was given the diagnoses by various psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, and therapists od Bipolar Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  One PA of a very respected psychiatrist ordered me to be on a medication regimen which required me to take 13 pills a day.  One medication (very recently) had given me such a severe allergic reaction that I remained in a state of psychosis for 6 months.  An elevated white blood cell count (along with an extensive barrage of other diagnostic tests ruling out other causes of an elevated WBC count) confirmed the allergic reaction.  I cannot take psychotropic medications.  Because of my hypersensitivity to others... I cannot be in a relationship.  Talking about my traumatic life experiences to a therapist helped a little.  Reaching out to a free community service which sent case workers out to my home once a week to check on my suicidality status helped.  Hiring a therapist that performed home visits was helpful.  Hyper-evaluating myself daily checking for signs of progress was frustrating... But, helped me stay focused on my symptoms from an objective rather than subjective point-of-view.  Super-studying the diagnoses I was given helped me understand my enemies were not my family.... But, were neurological & psychological.  The only being and force that has brought me through to the point of healing I've reached now and delivered me from people which were feeding off of my illness was my Lord Jesus.  My God never left me. He never talked down to me, never discouraged me, and told me only beautiful truth.  The mind and the physical world have a bidirectional relationship which causes either damage or healing to occur.  The same is true for our spiritual life... It effects our mind and our body.

       " 'Borderline Personality Disorder, like all other personality disorders, is an abnormal way of perceiving and interacting with the world. Think of it as having a dirty filter that the sufferer sees the world through constantly. We do not believe it is caused by chemical imbalances in the brain, but it\\'s possible that some of the symptoms might because medication *can* help some sufferers (but doesn\\'t help everyone). Because they perceive things incorrectly, they often react inappropriately to situations that occur. People with BPD typically (not always as there is some room for deviation) have problems with emotional regulation and may react incorrectly to unexpected situations that occur. They may be perceived by others as being moody and reactive. They often have problems with trusting other people. It\\'s believed this occurs because of unhealthy childhood experiences with parents, caregivers, teachers, and peers. However, there may also be a genetic propensity for people to have BPD as well. Regardless, they tend to have short-lived, intense relationships with lovers where they cling one minute and push away the next. They often have issues with infidelity due to a fear that they will be abandoned. There\\'s a real fear of abandonment and rejection. They tend to have black and white thinking (things are all wrong or all good) and that means they often either idealize or villainize their lovers, depending on their mood. This leaves the lover often feelling like they don\\'t really know what\\'s going on or where they stand in the relationship. One minute, the lover is being adored and the next, they are being pushed away. If there\\'s infidelity or other types of self-damaging, risky behavior occurring, the lover may eventually get fed up. Because of this behavior and their intense lack of trust, quite often...the sufferer does cause their lover to leave them. This, of course, reinforces their belief that they will always be abandoned, left, and/or alone...and the cycle of clinging/pushing away starts again with a new person usually quite soon afterward. It should be noted...This black and white thinking tends to color their perception and behavior in regards to themselves, their self esteem, their self concept, and the world around them. Quite often, they are hypersensitive to criticism (or even perceived criticism). This goes back to that deep seeded fear of being rejected or abandoned. More than likely, they lived in a household situation with a parent or caregiver who would...one minute seemingly dote on the child and the next, without obvious reason...push the child away. Inconsistent, inattentive, cold, neglectful or absentee parenting seems to be a big part of the reason a person with BPD MAY have had it develop. Since we learn to trust from the first people in our lives (usually, our parents)....if a parent proves to be untrustworthy, absent, cold, or inconsistent with affection/punishment...a child may learn that they can\\'t trust anyone. Deep down, people with BPD don\\'t always trust themselves, either. \\n\\nBecause they tend to have very black and white thinking, they don\\'t always handle situations very well. This \"just world\" concept where they seem to think that \"good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people\" can cause them to see themselves as bad/evil/wrong if something bad happens to them, even things they can\\'t control. \\n\\nIn addition, they often have feelings of intense anger if things don\\'t go as they expected, especially if it deals with other people. Their expectations of other people are usually unrealistic (because their expectations of themselves and the world are unrealistic generally.) They may get physically violent or abusive when things don\\'t go the way they expected. During a period of devaluation of their love partner, they may become violent or abusive (note: this doesn\\'t happen with every BPD sufferer, but it is a common enough occurrence that it should be said). \\n\\nThey have intense changes in feelings and react quickly to situations without always thinking things through. They can be self-damaging and impulsive. This is where people get it confused with Bipolar disease because Bipolar tends to cause highs and lows and emotional reactivity during those periods. People with BPD have this issue all the time, however...not just when they are experiencing a disease relapse from one extreme or the other.',\n",

If you two have been together over 5 years I am sure he has seen you at your best and your worse. My suggestion to you is to look into if you have a stabilization center near you. I have had to do it a couple times in the past. You can check yourself in as a walk in , average stay is 3-5 days. If you truly want to help yourself then becoming stable should be your priority. And once you do this ,you will see the talk from him of leaving was just his way of trying to get you to realize you need the help.\",\n",

But he must not have very much respect for you, let alone love, if he could go out and sleep with someone else knowing the effect it would have on you. My husband actually did cheat on me. Then he came home and threw it in my face because he knew it would be the one thing that would hurt me the most. And to make matters even worse, he had the affair on New Years, which means not only will I always remember the exact day it happened, but I\\'ll start each new year angry, hurt, and resentful. Yeah, fun for me. I can tell you from experience that it does get easier to live with. Eventually you\\'ll reach a point where it\\'s not the very first thing you think about when you wake up in the morning. You\\'ll always have that brick in your chest where your heart used to be, but since it\\'s always there, you\\'ll get used to it and won\\'t notice it so much anymore. But there will always be those impossible-to-answer questions that\\'ll cause you to lose sleep at night. \\n\\n\"Does he really love me?\" \\n\"How could he do this to me?\"\\n\"Why her?\" \\n\"Does he have feelings for her?\" \\n\"Will he do it again?\" \\n\"Am I an idiot for taking him back?\" \\n\"Does the fact that I did make me weak?\"\\n\"Is she better than me?\" \\n\\nThose questions will drive you insane at night. I understand how you feel. Like you, I love my husband more than anything, too, and it\\'s HARD to get past a betrayal of that magnitude. Fortunately, my husband didn\\'t get his squeeze toy pregnant, so I don\\'t have to worry about her being in my face for the rest of my life, and I can\\'t even begin to imagine how that must feel. I honestly don\\'t think I could\\'ve handled it, so he probably would\\'ve been gone under those circumstances. It just depends on you and how you feel. Ask yourself which is stronger.. Your love for him, or the resentment you feel toward him? You may not have reached the resentful stage yet, but trust me, you will. And keep in mind that men are very physical creatures (shocker), whereas as women are very emotional. For them, sex isn\\'t always just about pleasure. It\\'s something they often resort to in times of stress, anger, sadness, and loneliness because their brains aren\\'t wired to express emotion like women\\'s are. For men, sex is often used as an outlet, so it could be that he was missing you and just used her to make himself feel better (a lot of women out there are reading that last part going, \"Umm.. No.\" lol), which was a really shitty thing to do in my opinion, but everyone handles things differently, I suppose. Keep in mind that I am in NO way justifying what either of our husbands did. Men might not be as emotionally complicated as women, but they know right from wrong and have the ability to control their actions just like anyone else. But if you love your husband half as much as I love mine, you won\\'t leave him no matter how many people advise you to. So I\\'m just trying to help you look at it a different way to give you some peace of mind and hopefully make it a little easier on you. You\\'ll probably always love him regardless, but your feelings for him will never be the same after this. So you just have to ask yourself if you\\'re prepared to live with that. But you\\'re not \"weak\" or \"stupid\" if you choose to stay. Not that anyone implied that, but that\\'s how I spent a lot of time feeling when my husband did what he did. I\\'d say to myself, \"How could I possibly take him back after that? I must be crazy. Normal people don\\'t stay with someone who cheated on them. They leave! I must be the weakest, stupidest person on the planet.\" But after a while, I realized it was the complete opposite. It takes a STRONG person to stay and get past something like that cuz it hurts worse than just about anything. I\\'d rather have both my legs cut out from underneath me than ever feel like that again. I hope something I said made you feel a little better cuz I know what that kind of heartache feels like and I wouldn\\'t wish it on my worst enemy. It will get easier, I promise, but your feelings will never be the same',\n",

I tried to explain things, but they weren\\'t listening, it was like talking to walls, so I hurriedly rushed out of the apartment, drove my car fast away from them, I was crying, I felt miserable, when I arrived home, I noticed a text from one of them saying: \"are you on drugs?\", it was the most hurtful text i have ever received, I will never forget this text, instead of saying something nice, they still wanted to hurt me some more. I never replied and I never saw them again.

One of the pots had a crack in it, and while the other pot was perfect and always delivered a full portion of water at the end of the long walk from the stream to the master\\'s house, the cracked pot arrived only half full. For a full two years this went on daily, with the bearer delivering only one and one half pots of water in his master\\'s house.\\n\\nThe perfect pot was proud of its accomplishments, perfect to the end for which it was made. But the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection, and miserable that it was able to accomplish only half of what it had been made to do. After two years of what it perceived to be a bitter failure, it spoke to the Water Bearer one day by the stream. \"I am ashamed of myself, and I want to apologize to you.\" \"Why?\" asked the bearer. \"What are you ashamed of?\" \"I have been able, for these past two years, to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your master\\'s house. Because of my flaws, you have to do all of this work, and you don\\'t get full value from your efforts,\" the pot said.\\n\\nThe Water Bearer felt sorry for the old cracked pot, and in his compassion he said, \"As we return to the master\\'s house, I want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path.\" Indeed, as they went up the hill, the old cracked pot took notice of the sun warming the beautiful wild flowers on the side of the path, and this cheered it some. But at the end of the trail, it still felt bad because it had leaked out half its load, and so again it apologize to the bearer for its failure. The bearer said to the pot, \"Did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of your path, but not on the other pot\\'s side? That\\'s because I have always known about your flaw, and I took advantage of it. I planted flower seeds on your side of the path, and every day while we walk back from the stream, you\\'ve watered them. For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my master\\'s table. Without you being just the way you are, he would not have this beauty to grace his house.\"',\n",

Not knowing desturbs us and for what its worth, I think we are who and what we are because we have the truth inside ourselves as life is supposed to by lived by yet the normal peoples in acceptance of life is far fetched from the truth that we came into being with. So don\\'t  feel sorry for being honest, true, consistent, caring, loving, supportive and brave enough to live and love. As \"mentally I\\'ll people\", no one deserves us unless they know how to love as we do, the right way, the only way, the real way. We are real people. The minute everyone accepts that, we can all feel free within and do what the likes of Bill Gates, Einstein, Richard Brandon and so many others hthat has contributed massively to the advancement of this world can do. So accept your delve as an already evolved being and that you are more valuable to this life than many. People fear you because they know you can do so much better. Own it, own what you gave. These qualities you have that so many aspire to become. The irony is that they seek us out to experience only yge laughter and joy that rubbs off on them in our company. No more unnessasary apologies for things another persons weakness makes you speak the truth of. I love you and you are all magnificent. Please forgive any spelling errors.

You should likely have a personal safety plan prepared (meaning you have someone to go be with when you feel especially depressed, vulnerable, or suicidal).  You definitely need to be seeing a doctor for your bipolar disorder, if you aren't already.  It's an illness that needs to be medically treated.  You definitely can't change that by yourself.  It's like thinking that if you had cancer or diabetes, you could just change it by wanting to or thinking hard enough about it.  That's not how it works.  You probably know that bipolar disorder is usually caused by chemical imbalances in the brain.  You need medications to help with getting your brain chemistry back on a healthy midline for you.\\n\\nYour depression is probably causing you to have pervasive thoughts and thought loops (just in case you don't know what that is as many people wouldn't...that's when you get the same awful, negative thoughts and memories playing over and over in your mind.  You try to get away from them, but they often are intrusive and disturbing.)  Depression is BAD about causing those.  You sound like you might also have a bit of PTSD from being bullied.  All of those things can be treated well and effectively.  You need to see a doctor.  If you are really thinking of running away or doing anything damaging to yourself, please seek out help at a hospital.  There are people who can help you and who will care for you.  \\n\\nAnd, Ethan, I know this may be hard for you to believe right now, but you NEVER deserved to be bullied.  You didn't ask for it.  The bullies were the ones who were 100% in the wrong...and NOT you.  Please do not take to heart anything they may've said about you.  Bullies deliberately try to find something to hurt their victims with.  Quite often, they seem to know exactly where our vulnerabilities and insecurities lie and attack us there.  Here's the thing...they're in the wrong and I'm sure the things they said about you were cruel, awful, and negative.  I don't know you personally, but I do know that no one...and I mean this...NO ONE deserves to be treated like that.  Please don't let them keep bullying you even now in your mind.  Whenever those thoughts and memories come back into your mind, try to confront them.  Try to explain to yourself why those things were incorrect or why those people were wrong about you.  Rebuild your inner strength by focusing on all the GOOD that I'm sure exists in you and all the good you've done in your life.  Those bullies didn't know the real you...the one deep inside.  Only you and those closest to you really know you.  So don't let these bullies and their stupid hatefulness steal another moment of your life from you.  \\n\\nPlease get yourself some help for your bipolar and depression.  Those can be treated and you might find all those negative thoughts and memories eventually fade with treatment.\\n\\nYou have only my very best wishes for a better future.\",\n",

       " 'NOT everyone has depression.  Your boss is a twit.  Depression is an illness.  That\\'s like saying that everyone has heart disease or diabetes.  He\\'s an idiot.  \\n\\nAbout self-harm...Quite often, self harm is caused by a need to have control in one\\'s own life (a feeling of helplessness that combines with depression for a very nasty mix).  It\\'s time you got some control back.\\n\\n1.  This is of the utmost importance.  Get a new job.  There\\'s absolutely NO reason to put up with verbal abuse from an employer.  He should show more professionalism.  You shouldn\\'t have to put up with it.  I know it\\'s scary, but you\\'ll feel more in control of your life if you start looking for a new job.  I\\'ve worked a lot in my life and I\\'ve only ever had ONE boss who thought it was okay to cuss her employees.  First time she did it to me, I quit that moment.  Please don\\'t put up with that crap.  It\\'s apparent the job doesn\\'t give you insurance, so there\\'s no reason for you to be there when you can find something better.\\n\\nMaybe your next job shouldn\\'t be as a customer service rep?  It doesn\\'t seem to be a good fit for you personally, especially at this point in your life.  Look into doing things you\\'d love instead.  \\n\\n2.  FRIENDS don\\'t just run away when things get rough.  TRUE friends will do what they can to help you.  Maybe it\\'s time you assessed the people you have been hanging around?  You need to find new friends (real ones), but you can\\'t do that until you get your depression under control.  \\n\\n3.  Go back to church.  There has to be like the little volunteer lady or the Pastor or his wife or someone who is known for being compassionate.  Talk to them.  If nothing else, ask to talk to your pastor for spiritual counseling.  It\\'s free and it might help you somewhat (if nothing else, you\\'d have someone to talk to for a bit about what you\\'re feeling.)\\n\\n4.  Check into local mental health resources that might be available for cheap or free in your area.  There may be a support group you can join.  You don\\'t have to be alone.\\n\\nDepression is an ILLNESS.  It is systemic.  It starts in the mind, but it\\'s not long before it takes control of the entire body.  You need to have it treated like you would if you had pneumonia or diabetes or any other serious illness.  You\\'d go to the doctor for it.  If you must, go to an ER.  If there\\'s a \"charity\" hospital in your town, go to their ER.  You desperately need to be treated for your depression.  You might need medications.  Depression is often caused by chemical imbalances in a person\\'s brain.  You can\\'t \"sleep it off.\"  It doesn\\'t work that way.  That\\'d be like telling the person with diabetes (a chemical imbalance dealing with the pancreas) that they can just sleep it away.  That\\'s not how any of this works.  \\n\\nIf you take nothing else from my post, please remember this...\\n\\nDepression is a LIAR.  It lies to you about your worth, your own abilities, your life, and the people who love you.  It tells you that no one cares.  It says that everyone hates you or that they\\'d be better off without you.  It whispers that you will never be good enough or that you\\'ll never amount to anything...or your dreams for your life will never be fulfilled.  These are LIES.  It says the same type of things to every sufferer.  Those lies play like a broken record in your mind.  You need to get away from them.  Medication and therapy would do a lot for you.  If you\\'re cutting a LOT, you may need some hospital time.  It would definitely make people in your life take you more seriously when you say that you\\'re sick.  \\n\\nDon\\'t kill yourself or anything like that, please.  Keep reaching out.  There are people who will respond who are willing to be there for you.  The world is a big place with a lot of wonderful people in it who would help you, care for you, and be there for you.

There are usually income based therapists in every location (in my state they're called north key) but you can google it. Be strong. Keep pushing. Pray. God has a plan for your pain.

Here are some concrete steps you can take that will help you feel a little bit better within a week - please try them!!  The biggest problem with depression is we do not even try the steps people advise us to take because we dont believe they will work.  Do them anyway please!!  1) Get at least 9 hours sleep per night - if you cannot sleep by midnight, take ONE tylenol pm - this is the safest sleeping pill on the market.  If it makes you too groggy cut it in half and take half a pill.  But whatever happens you need to sleep 9 hours per night.  2) Make it a regular sleep - go to bed at the same time each night (9:30pm for example) and get up at the same time each night.  3) DONT drink caffeine or alcohol - if you love coffee get a decaf coffee substitute - there are nice tasting ones out there.  If you like to drink fruity cocktails, replace it with orange juice and lemonade mixed together (tastes just as good as cocktails) with cranberry or cherry juice added if you like..  3) Get a counsellor and book an appointment every week for an hour each week.  If you dont have health insurance use online counselling like talkspace - google it.   4) EVERY DAY go for a walk for at least one hour outside - not in a shopping mall - outside where you come into contact with nature in some way.  Even if you hate the idea of going for a walk and everything in your body is telling you not to go for that walk go anyway.  If you can, get a friend to go with you.. or family member or whatever..  5) DONT eat sugary or fatty products.  Eat foods that are as close to straight out of the ground as you can.  Even if that sounds horrible, please do it, it will really help.   6) Attend a support group - Emotions Anonymous is a great one - often local churches and mental hospitals have support groups for people with depression - find one and attend - I know its very very difficult, but you will be so glad you did!    I know these steps sound completely impossible but please try them - they will help you feel so much better.  If you are in that place where even these simple steps are just completely impossible, consider full time therapy as an outpatient to a local mental hospital',\n",

Learning that God wants THE BEST for everyone, and that He wants me to \"flee from sexual immorality\"(1 Corinthians 6:18) and to \"abstain from sexual immorality. Each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not with greedy, uncontrolled sexual passion\" (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5) has, quite literally, helped me to OVERCOME this disorder. You can win this battle, too. It includes keeping busy in \"holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion\", getting your mind off your sexual urges and desires. Prayer, serious prayer, begging for help to control your passions, is vital. You can find more Bible information on this topic at wol.jw.org where you can search for published articles on Bible topics. It would be wise to seriously consider beginning the free Bible study program from Jehovah\\'s Witnesses. You can request one on their website: jw.org',\n",
